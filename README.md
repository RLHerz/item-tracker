- Update the quantity and price of existing products.
- View details of a specific product or the entire inventory.
- Delete products from the inventory.
- Export the inventory data to a text file for backup or analysis.

## Usage

1. **Run the program:** `python inventory_management.py` (replace `inventory_management.py` with the actual file name)

2. **Follow the menu prompts:** The program will display a menu with options:
   - Add Product
   - Update Product Quantity 
   - Update Product Price

## Example Usage

Inventory Management System
1. Add product
2. Update product quantity
3. Update product price
4. View specific product
5. View all inventory
6. Delete product
7. Export inventory
0. Exit

**Enter your choice: 1**

Enter the name of the product: apple
Enter the quantity: 100
Enter the price: 1.50

... (Continue interacting with the menu to add, update, view, delete, or export products)

## Notes

- The inventory data is stored in a Python dictionary within the program's memory. Data is not persistent, meaning it will be lost when the program exits.
- The export feature saves data to a plain text file with comma-separated values.

## Future Improvements

- Add support for loading inventory data from a file.
- Implement a more robust search function (e.g., using regular expressions). 
- Explore using a database for persistent data storage.
